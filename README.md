# Park_Clarke_Transforms_C

C implementation of the Park and Clark transforms, as well as their inverses.</br>  
Requires `<math.h>` for `sin()` and `cos()`.</br> 
</br> 
The Park transform converts three-phase vectors in the time domain to a stationary two-phase vector.</br>
The Clarke transform rotates the two-phase vector into a consistent reference frame.
